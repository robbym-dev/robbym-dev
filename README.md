### Hi there, I'm Robby Manihani 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently a student at Stanford University studying the Computer Science on the AI track. 

- ⚡ Co-advised by Prof. Christopher Ré and Prof. Azalia Mirhoseini at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL); I am currently collaborating with Matei Zaharia and Christopher Potts in researching an inagural Automated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generated (RAG) Systems - check out the ARES project I'm working on [here](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ARES/tree/main)! On the flip side, I have a keen interest in software development and am working as a Software Engineer at Carta, Stanford's premier course planning platform used by 95% of undergrads.
- 
- 🛝 In my free time I enjoy trying new foods, mixing music, and as a Colorado native, I love hitting the slopes and snowboarding.

### 📫 I would love to talk! 

Email me at manihani@stanford.edu. Would love to build something together!
