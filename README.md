### Hi there, I'm Robby Manihani 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently a student at Stanford University studying the AI track in Computer Science and Natural Language track in Symbolic Systems. 

- ⚡ I have a deep fascination in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and co-advised by Prof. Christopher Ré and Prof. Azalia Mirhoseini at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL); I am currently researching an inagural Automated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generated Systems in the Hazy Lab. On the flip side, I am also currently working as a Software Engineer @Stanford-Carta and have a keen interest in software development. 

- 🌱 Particularly, I'm drawn to the dynamic world of startups, where ideas transform into impactful realities.

- 🛝 In my free time I enjoy trying new foods, mixing music, and as a Colorado native, I love hitting the slopes and snowboarding.

### 📫 I would love to talk! 

Email me at manihani@stanford.edu. Would love to build something together!
